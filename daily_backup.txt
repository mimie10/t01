Suggestion for daily backup:

We can use the cron utility that is a package linux supplies.
Cron sets the certain script to be executed on a regular basis.
In our case we will only use it to define the hour and the minutes since we want it to work every day.
It should look something like this:

# m h dom mon dow   command
0 22 * * * bash /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
